# ENMeval version 1.9.0
R package for automated tuning and evaluations of ecological niche models

[`ENMeval`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ENMeval) is an R package that performs automated tuning and evaluations of ecological niche models. The package includes the functionality to specify any algorithm of choice, but comes out of the box with two implementations of Maxent: maxnet [(Phillips *et al.* 2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.03049) from the ['maxnet' R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maxnet) and maxent.jar [(Phillips *et al.* 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.03.026), available [here](http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/). 

Model tuning refers to the process of building models with varying complexity settings, then choosing optimal settings based on some criteria. As it is difficult to predict in advance what level of complexity fits your data best and results in the most ecologically realistic response for your species, model tuning can be an essential tool for ENM studies. Model tuning helps researchers maximize predictive ability and avoid overfitting. In other words, it helps optimize model complexity to balance goodness-of-fit and predictive ability. The function  `ENMevaluate()` returns several items including a table of evaluation results, lists of models and raster predictions for each complexity setting combination, a metadata object with details about the analysis, and other related data. The package also has tools for null model simulations to determine significance and effect sizes of performance metrics, tools for calculating niche overlap between predictions, a suite of visualization tools, parallel processing functionality, a vignette with a complete analysis walk-through, and more. 

For a more detailed description of the original package (version 0.3.0 and below), check out the open-access publication:

Also see the vignette for examples of implementation.

Note that as of version 0.3.0, the default implementation uses the ['maxnet' R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maxnet).  The output from this differs from that of the original java program and so some features are not compatible (e.g., variable importance, the old html output).  Our team has done some fairly extensive testing to ensure this implementation gives the expected results but the maxnet implementation is relatively new (at the time of writing this) and we encourage users to scrutinize their results.
